# High Country Angular

High Country Angular is a group of tech enthusiasts, web designers, software developers and engineers, gathering together on a regular basis to share knowledge, ideas, and lessons learned in working with the Angular framework.

We are working hard to create a culture of honor where questions big and small from beginners to experts are treated with the same respect.

> In git, files are always in one of 3 stages: Committed, Modified, or Staged

> "git status" and notice how README.md has been modified

> Add README.md to staging with one of the following commands...

```
$ git add README.md
OR
$ git add . -v
```

#### OH [obscenity]!

> You realized you didn't actually want to add that file to staging yet...
